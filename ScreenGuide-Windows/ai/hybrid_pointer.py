"""
Hybrid pointer — ScreenGuide pointing accuracy upgrade.

The original grid-locator was inaccurate because it asked the LLM to guess
pixel coordinates from a numbered grid overlay. Vision models trained on
natural images don't have pixel-precise spatial reasoning, so they'd often
pick a neighboring cell or off-by-one row, sending ScreenGuide's blue cursor to
the wrong button.

This module uses a three-tier resolver, each tier much more accurate than the next:

  Tier 1  Windows UI Automation (UIA)     ~5 ms     pixel-perfect
          Walks the OS accessibility tree, finds elements by name/role.
          Works in every standard UI: Chrome/Edge/Firefox, VS Code, IDEs,
          Office, Electron apps, native Win32, WinUI/UWP, Settings, etc.

  Tier 2  Offline OCR (RapidOCR/ONNX)     ~300 ms   text-perfect
          For canvas apps where UIA gives no tree: Figma, Photoshop, games,
          older Java/Swing UIs. Runs entirely on CPU, no API calls.

  Tier 3  Vision LLM grid fallback        ~1-3 s    best effort
          Only used when UIA + OCR both whiff. Delegates to the existing
          element_locator.py — kept as a safety net.

Public API:
    find_target(query: str) -> Optional[Target]

The caller (companion_manager) treats Target as opaque — it has .center_xy
in LOGICAL screen pixels, ready to feed directly into the overlay pointer.
